Basic Concepts
Introduction

What is NumPy?
Advantages of NumPy over Python lists.
Installation

pip install numpy.
Creating Arrays

From lists or tuples.
Using NumPy functions: zeros, ones, full, arange, linspace, random.
Identity and diagonal matrices.
Array Attributes

Shape, size, ndim, dtype, itemsize.
Array Initialization and Conversion

Convert Python lists to NumPy arrays.
Typecasting arrays using .astype().
Indexing, Slicing, and Iteration
Indexing

Accessing elements in 1D, 2D, and nD arrays.
Fancy indexing (indexing with lists or arrays).
Slicing

Subsets of arrays using slicing.
Boolean Indexing

Conditional subsetting.
Use of np.where.
Iterating

Looping through arrays using for and np.nditer.
Operations on Arrays
Element-wise Operations

Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and power.
Broadcasting

How NumPy handles operations between arrays of different shapes.
Aggregate Functions

sum, min, max, mean, median, std, var.
Matrix Operations

Dot product: np.dot.
Matrix multiplication: @ or np.matmul.
Transpose: .T.
Reshaping and Manipulation
Reshaping Arrays

reshape, ravel, and flatten.
Concatenation and Splitting

Joining arrays using np.concatenate, np.vstack, np.hstack.
Splitting arrays using np.split.
Changing Dimensions

Adding/removing dimensions with np.expand_dims, squeeze.
Sorting and Searching

Sorting arrays: np.sort.
Searching for elements: np.where, np.argmin, np.argmax.
Advanced Concepts
Linear Algebra

Determinants: np.linalg.det.
Inverses: np.linalg.inv.
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors: np.linalg.eig.
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD): np.linalg.svd.
Random Number Generation

Uniform distribution: np.random.rand.
Normal distribution: np.random.normal.
Other distributions: np.random.randint, np.random.choice.
Statistical Functions

Percentiles: np.percentile.
Histograms: np.histogram.
Advanced Indexing

Multi-dimensional indexing.
Masking arrays.
Broadcasting Rules

Rules of shape compatibility for operations.
Special Functions
Mathematical Functions

Trigonometric functions: sin, cos, tan.
Exponentials and logarithms: exp, log.
Rounding functions: round, floor, ceil.
Handling Missing Data

np.nan, np.isnan, and np.nan_to_num.
Practical Applications
Data Manipulation

Cleaning data using masking and indexing.
Data aggregation for statistics.
Image Processing

Using NumPy arrays to represent images.
Integration with Other Libraries

Pandas: for data analysis.
Matplotlib: for visualization.
Efficient Computation

Performance comparison with Python loops.
Use of np.vectorize.
Visualization of Arrays
Although NumPy doesn’t directly offer visualization tools, it integrates well with Matplotlib to plot data.
